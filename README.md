## 👀 About Me
🔹I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at Gannon University, where I am engaged in pioneering IoT projects as part of my Master's degree in Computer and Information Science, specializing in Software Engineering. My primary focus is on developing dynamic, user-friendly web applications using a variety of technologies including Python, JavaScript, Laravel, and MQTT. These applications are designed to address real-world challenges and improve user experiences.
